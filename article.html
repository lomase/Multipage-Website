                    <div class="picture col-7">God of War is the latest main entry to a series that sold PS2s and PS3s from hype and gameplay quality alone.The game 
                      features an older Kratos in the realm of Norse Mythology on a quest with his son tagging along for the journey. The game and story reinvented the 
                      series and Kratos as a character and really changes your perspective on him if you have any prior experience with the series. Turning from a pure 
                      hack and slash to an action-rpg didn’t hurt the series at all and gave this game it’s own identity and breathed new life into that hadn’t had an entry 
                      since 2013. Everything from the character and enemy designs to the environment is truly beautiful and it was absolutely worth the wait. The game is 
                      easily my favorite of the series and a favorite of all time with every pixel of it’s being. It is complete from beginning to end and is one of the few 
                      AAA games in our current generation to not have any DLC at all.</div>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-7">Super Smash Bros Ultimate is the definitive Super Smash experience. It’s by far the biggest and most ambitious video 
                      game crossover of all time and features characters from Nintendo’s vast list of IPs like Mario, Link, and Samus, as well as other 
                      properties outside of Nintendo’s like Snake from Metal Gear and Mega Man from the Mega Man series. It’s a family friendly beat-em up with 
                      the goal of knocking your opponent(s) out of the arena. Every character that has made an appearance in a Smash Bros game makes a playable 
                      appearance in Ultimate with a few tweaks to bring them up to speed all while keeping familiar movesets so you immediately snap back into playing 
                      them. Stages and music tracks from previous games also make a return and very few are left out. The game’s campaign allows players to unlock the 
                      roster by battling them across a large overworld map, while they collect spirits that give you various abilities in battle. The campaign map is 
                      vast and filled with challenges that seem unfair until you gain the perfect spirit to counter their effects. /</div>

                    <div class="picture col-7"> Marvels’s Spider-Man for the PS4 is like a movie you can’t buy a ticket for. The game is easily 
                      the best in the webslinger’s long line of games. Everything about the game feels great rom the combat and webslinging (possibly the 
                      best part of the game) to the story and open world of New York to explore. The map is huge and you’ll find yourself loving this as you 
                      sling from building to building totally ignoring fast travel simply because it’s that much fun. The game has a combat system inspired by 
                      the Batman Arkham series, but makes fair use of our hero’s very unique abilities and gadgets. When you’re not playing the story missions 
                      you might find yourself gathering collectibles all over the city, stopping random petty crimes, or checking out that new costume you just unlocked. 
                      The game has plenty to offer with plenty of side missions and DLC content to complete after you complete the story, which I might add is wonderful 
                      from beginning to end and loves to flip your expectations at every corner.</div>
