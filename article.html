                  <h2>Mega Man: Battle Network 5</h2>
                Mega Man Battle Network 5 came in two variants being Team Colonel and 
                Team Protoman with Double Team DS being the best of both worlds and giving you two games
                 in one with some bonus features. Although the game was not the last entry in the series 
                 it is definitely the best experience of the series and having both versions in one cartridge
                  sweetened the deal. The game is an RPG that follows Lan and his Navi Mega Man, as they are 
                  recruited by Colonel or Protoman (version dependant) to put together a team and take down 
                  an evil organization. Each game features different allies you’ll befriend and transformations
                   based off of these allies throughout the story, but follow the same general story with tweaks unique 
                   to each game. I found myself playing the game for hours collecting battle chips to defeat
                    enemies on a 3x6 grid and doing side missions and liberation missions, a turn based mode
                     where you and your team set out to liberate various parts of the Net from dark Navis and
                      viruses where you get rewards based on how many turns you liberate an area in./</div>

                  <h2>Mega Man: Star Force 3</h2>
                Mega Man Star Force 3 is an rpg that came in two separate versions being Black 
                Ace and Red Joker. Both games feature the same gameplay and story with tweaks between the two of them that
                 make them unique, but they cover the same story. They are in my opinion the definitive Star Force 
                 experience and the series as a whole was overlooked and didn’t get their roses due to the Mega Man fatigue
                  going on during the time the series was releasing. Regardless just like their predecessors it features a 
                  colorful cast of characters set in the future with technology way beyond ours and follows our protagonist
                  (s) Geo and Omega Xis, who wave change to become Mega Man, saving the world from an evil organization 
                  bent on taking over the world (I feel like I'm noticing a theme here). The combat is familiar to anyone 
                  who has played a Battle Network series entry and features our hero on a 3x6 grid in a 3rd person view
                   using various collectable battle cards to defeat your enemies. One thing I love is that, while playing
                    a previous entry may help in catching throwback references it is entirely not needed to understand the
                     story and character relationships as they are expanded upon as you battle, explore, and complete side
                      quests. The game features a fun story post-game and has plenty of collectibles for completionist,
                       although you will need a friend with the opposite version for some of them. The game features plenty
                        of bosses that you can challenge multiple times and random encounter bosses with massive upgrades
                         over the previous incarnations.</div>

                  <h2>Jet Set Radio Future</h2>
                Jet Set Radio Future is a colorful Action Sports featuring a gang of 
                inline skaters spray painting Tokyo with graffiti and taking control of the city from rival 
                gangs and the corrupted police department. The game is vibrant with life and music along with
                 a colorful cast of characters throughout the story from beginning to end. As stated before the
                  game centers around the protagonist and their gang taking Tokyo by storm and spraying graffiti
                   over other gangs marked territory all, while evading and defeating the police department that
                    tries to stop you at every turn. Each level is large and filled with plenty to see and explore
                     as you skate, grind, and spray paint your way thru the environment all to a wonderful soundtrack
                      playing and being mixed in the background. The soundtrack is one of my personal favorites of all
                       time and crosses multiple genres and is probably the reason my music taste is as diverse as it 
                       is. I frequently found myself revisiting areas to try and get all the collectibles, which
                        included new graffiti tags and new music tracks.

                  <h2>Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy</h2>
                Dissidia 012 [Duodecim] Final Fantasy (what is with Square Enix and 
                these Latin based names) is a RPG Arena Fighter featuring various Villains and Heroes of the main
                 entry Final Fantasy games battling on the side of Cosmos and Chaos in a set of unending war cycles

                   multiple music tracks from each of the numbered titles. Characters come equipped with multiple flashy
                    and iconic moves and gear/accessories to give them various abilities and an edge in combat over their
                     opponent or even the playing field with an enemy who is higher leveled. Each character has an EX Mode
                     transformation and EX burst finishing move that are all flashy and exciting to execute. The goal
                      of combat is to build up Bravery in combat with bravery attacks and assists and use HP attacks to
                       deal HP damage to your opponent and reduce them to 0. The game comes complete with a story mode,
                        arcade mode, and free battles and plenty of collectibles to gather throughout the various modes

                  <h2>Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R</h2>
                Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus R (try saying that 3 times fast) is the definitive
                 version of Guilty Gear XX that released on the PS2 back in 2003 (2002 for Japan) with the most up 
                 to date version coming out in May of 2019 for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a 2D fighter that 
                 oozes personality from the characters and story, to the music and stages it’s very bright and in your
                  face. The game is made by Arc System Works, who is a giant in the fighting game community and their 
                  games continually bring out a crowd at fighting game tournaments like EVO. The game hosts over 2
                   dozen characters each with their own style of play and personality. The game holds a special place
                    in my heart for it’s technical mastery and style that’s loud and in your face during combat. The
                     levels are unique and have great rock tracks with each character having their own theme that plays
                      during battle. The game is very rock inspired with references being subtle or blatant like the
                       vampire gentleman named Slayer after the band./</div>

                <h2>God of War</h2>
                God of War is the latest main entry to a series that sold PS2s and PS3s from hype and gameplay quality alone.The game 
                features an older Kratos in the realm of Norse Mythology on a quest with his son tagging along for the journey. The game and story reinvented the 
                series and Kratos as a character and really changes your perspective on him if you have any prior experience with the series. Turning from a pure 
                hack and slash to an action-rpg didn’t hurt the series at all and gave this game it’s own identity and breathed new life into that hadn’t had an entry 
                since 2013. Everything from the character and enemy designs to the environment is truly beautiful and it was absolutely worth the wait. The game is 
                easily my favorite of the series and a favorite of all time with every pixel of it’s being. It is complete from beginning to end and is one of the few 
                AAA games in our current generation to not have any DLC at all.</div>

                <h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>
                Super Smash Bros Ultimate is the definitive Super Smash experience. It’s by far the biggest and most ambitious video 
                game crossover of all time and features characters from Nintendo’s vast list of IPs like Mario, Link, and Samus, as well as other 
                properties outside of Nintendo’s like Snake from Metal Gear and Mega Man from the Mega Man series. It’s a family friendly beat-em up with 
                the goal of knocking your opponent(s) out of the arena. Every character that has made an appearance in a Smash Bros game makes a playable 
                appearance in Ultimate with a few tweaks to bring them up to speed all while keeping familiar movesets so you immediately snap back into playing 
                them. Stages and music tracks from previous games also make a return and very few are left out. The game’s campaign allows players to unlock the 
                roster by battling them across a large overworld map, while they collect spirits that give you various abilities in battle. The campaign map is 
                vast and filled with challenges that seem unfair until you gain the perfect spirit to counter their effects. /</div>

                <h2>Marvel's Spider-Man</h2>
                Marvels’s Spider-Man for the PS4 is like a movie you can’t buy a ticket for. The game is easily 
                the best in the webslinger’s long line of games. Everything about the game feels great rom the combat and webslinging (possibly the 
                best part of the game) to the story and open world of New York to explore. The map is huge and you’ll find yourself loving this as you 
                sling from building to building totally ignoring fast travel simply because it’s that much fun. The game has a combat system inspired by 
                the Batman Arkham series, but makes fair use of our hero’s very unique abilities and gadgets. When you’re not playing the story missions 
                you might find yourself gathering collectibles all over the city, stopping random petty crimes, or checking out that new costume you just unlocked. 
                The game has plenty to offer with plenty of side missions and DLC content to complete after you complete the story, which I might add is wonderful 
                from beginning to end and loves to flip your expectations at every corner.</div>
